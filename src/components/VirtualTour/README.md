## Virtual Tour Component

To set up the virtual tour:

1. Create the following directory structure in your project:
```
public/
  virtual-tours/
    taj-mahal/
      entrance.jpg
      gardens.jpg
      dome.jpg
```

2. Add high-quality panoramic images (recommended size: 2000x1000px) to these directories.

3. Image requirements:
- Format: JPG or JPEG
- Aspect ratio: 2:1 (panoramic)
- Resolution: Minimum 2000x1000px
- File size: Optimize for web (< 500KB per image)

Example image sources:
- Professional photography
- 360Â° panoramic captures
- High-quality architectural photographs

Note: Ensure you have proper rights/licenses for all images used in the virtual tour.
